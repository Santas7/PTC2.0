# Probability of the sum of events
1. classical_probability_definition() - the classical definition of probability -> P(A) = m/n
2. probability_sum_events_1() - probability of the sum of events type 1
3. probability_sum_events_2() - probability of the sum of events type 2
4. probability_sum_joint_events() - probability of the sum of joint events
5. probability_at_least_one_hit() - the probability of at least one hit

# Probability of the product of events
1. The multiplication theorem for the probabilities of independent events:
    P(A⋅B)=P(A)⋅P(B)
2. Multiplication theorem for the probabilities of dependent events:
    P(A⋅B)=P(A)⋅P(B|A),P(A⋅B)=P(B)⋅P(A|B).  

# Conditional probability
1. conditional_probability() - calculation of conditional probability
